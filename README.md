## Background

This project was created to be used in an experiment for my non-developer friend's honours thesis.  I worked on it
alongside two other friends (both experienced C++ coders) who started the project off and handled the majority of the
development.

I helped with the design and coded some of the initial layout and functionality.  This was my first real experience
wih QT and C++.

## The Experiment

The participants had to manage allocation between two assets whose prices would move in real time during the experiment.
Participants would also have the opportunity to solve puzzles (on a different screen) while the market was moving.

At the end of the experiment they were rewarded based on the number of puzzles sold and the final value of their holdings
in the two assets.

In the experiment, the 'market' was programmed to 'crash' partway through, so that prices of both assets would begin
falling rapidly.  The thesis was that participants would check on their assets more regularly when the prices 
were falling and solve fewer puzzles during that time.
